            <h2>How to Play</h2>
            <p>Grow A Garden is a farming and idle simulation game where the goal is to plant crops, harvest them, and expand your garden through reinvestment. The game combines active gameplay elements with idle mechanics, allowing players to make progress both during play and while offline.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="doc-section content-box">
            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Planting:</strong> Begin by selecting a seed and clicking on an available soil patch. Seeds can be purchased using the in-game currency, Sheckles.</li>
                <li><strong>Growth:</strong> Each seed has a set time it takes to grow. Some plants mature quickly, while others take longer but provide greater rewards.</li>
                <li><strong>Harvesting:</strong> Once a plant is fully grown, you can harvest it and sell it to earn more Sheckles.</li>
                <li><strong>Expansion:</strong> Use your earnings to buy more land, unlock new seeds, purchase upgrades, and improve your efficiency.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="doc-section content-box">
            <h2>Key Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Idle Growth:</strong> Plants continue to grow even while you are offline. This idle system allows for continuous progress without requiring constant interaction, making the game suitable for both casual and dedicated players.</li>
                <li><strong>Crop Variety and Mutations:</strong> As you progress, you will unlock a wide variety of seeds. Some plants have the potential to mutate into rare variants, which are more valuable. These mutations may occur randomly or be influenced by special tools or pets.</li>
                <li><strong>Tools and Equipment:</strong> Over time, players gain access to gear that improves gardening efficiency. Certain upgrades help you earn more, grow faster, or unlock new areas more quickly.</li>
                <li><strong>Pets:</strong> Pets provide special bonuses to your garden, such as faster growth or higher mutation chances. While not necessary for early gameplay, pets become important tools for long-term success and optimization.</li>
                <li><strong>Events and Seasonal Updates:</strong> Occasionally, limited-time events introduce new seeds, mechanics, and cosmetics. These events provide opportunities to earn exclusive items and experiment with new features.</li>
                <li><strong>Garden Customization:</strong> Players can organize and arrange their gardens in different ways to suit personal preferences or maximize efficiency. Layout becomes increasingly important as your garden grows.</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="doc-section content-box">
            <h2>Tips for Beginners</h2>
            <p>If you're new to Grow A Garden, these beginner tips will help you start strong and build momentum early. Each one is designed to introduce core mechanics and good habits that will make your experience smoother and more rewarding.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Know Your Crops:</strong> Each plant in the game has different growth times, values, and potential mutations. Start by familiarizing yourself with the basic crops and their earnings. Quick-growing plants are excellent for learning the game and earning your first upgrades, while more advanced crops can be explored as you expand.</li>
                <li><strong>Use Your Land Space Efficiently:</strong> At the beginning, land is limited—so make every patch count. Group similar plants together and avoid leaving gaps in your layout. As your garden grows, planning where to place crops and tools will become even more important for both organization and performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Look Out for Rain and Thunderstorms:</strong> Weather plays a helpful role in the game. Rain and thunderstorms may trigger beneficial effects for your plants, such as faster growth or increased chances of mutations. When you notice weather changes, take advantage of the opportunity to plant high-reward crops or harvest strategically.</li>
                <li><strong>Mutations = More Money:</strong> Some crops have a chance to mutate into rare versions that sell for much higher prices. While not guaranteed, planting seeds with known mutation potential gives you a shot at significantly boosting your earnings. Keep an eye out for mutation patterns as you play.</li>
                <li><strong>Sprinklers Make Plants Grow Faster:</strong> While not available immediately, sprinklers are one of the first upgrades you should aim for. They help your crops grow faster, making it easier to harvest and replant more frequently. Investing in automation early pays off in both time and profit.</li>
                <li><strong>Complete Daily Quests:</strong> Daily quests provide extra rewards like Sheckles and sometimes exclusive items. They are often simple to complete and guide you toward exploring different features of the game. Make it a habit to check them each time you play.</li>
                <li><strong>Invite Your Friends:</strong> Playing with friends makes the game more fun and often comes with bonuses. Some rewards, like special pets or boosts, may be tied to inviting others or working together. Plus, comparing gardens is a great way to share strategies and stay motivated.</li>
            </ul>
