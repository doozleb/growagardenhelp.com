                        <tr><td>Bunny</td><td>Eats a carrot (normal or chocolate variant) and increases its selling value by 1.53x or more when it ages.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Dog</td><td>Tries to dig up a seed from your garden (Seed Shop ones) every minute. The seed isn't guaranteed, though, with a success rate of 5.14%.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Golden Lab</td><td>Works like the Dog but has a better shot at finding a seed, with a success rate of about 10.31%.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Bee</td><td>Goes to a random fruit or veggie every 24 minutes and 45 seconds and makes it Pollinated.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Black Bunny</td><td>Raises the price of carrots (or chocolate carrots) by 1.53 times when consumed, doing it just a bit sooner than a regular bunny.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Cat</td><td>Naps for 10.12 seconds every 1 minute and 20 seconds, making nearby fruits (within 10.12 studs) grow 1.25x bigger.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Chicken</td><td>Increases egg hatch speed by 10.36%.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Deer</td><td>Has a 2.53% chance of making berry fruits stay on the plant even after harvesting. Berry fruits include Celestiberry, Strawberry, Blueberry, Cranberry, and Raspberry.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Hedgehog</td><td>Makes prickly fruits 1.52 times larger. In Grow a Garden, prickly fruits include Cactus, Durian, Dragon Fruit, and Pineapple.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Kiwi</td><td>Finds and sits on the egg with the highest hatch time every minute, reducing its hatch time by 20.24%.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Monkey</td><td>Refunds fruits when selling (only 2.55% likelihood). Rare fruits like Beanstalk, Candy Blossom, Moon Mango, and more have a small chance of a return.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Orange Tabby</td><td>A better version of the cat. It sleeps for about 1.30 minutes and makes fruits within 15.16 studs become larger by 1.51% during that time.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Pig</td><td>Has a chance to turn nearby fruits within 15 studs into mutated variants. The likelihood of this occurring is just 2.02%, and the ability lasts for only 15.35 seconds every two minutes.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Rooster</td><td>Raises egg hatch speed by 20.93%.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Spotted Deer</td><td>Like the deer's trait, but boosts the chance of berry fruits remaining on the plant after picking to around 5.10%.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Honey Bee</td><td>Triggers the Pollinated mutation on plants every 19.43 minutes.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Blood Hedgehog</td><td>Makes prickly fruits 2.02% bigger, and any mutated ones among them sell for 1.16% more.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Blood Kiwi</td><td>Increases both the hatch time and hatch speed of eggs in your garden by 45.56% and 20.25%, respectively.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Cow</td><td>Speeds up the growth of all plants within 8.18 studs by 1.12%, making their fruits spawn faster than usual.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Frog</td><td>Makes a random crop grow faster for a full 24 hours, meaning its fruits ripen quicker. This ability activates every 19.48 minutes.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Mole</td><td>Around every 1.20 minutes, it digs up a gear or Sheckles for you. Gear includes a Trowel, Lightning Rod, Watering Can, all Sprinklers, and anything from the Gear Shop.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Moon Cat</td><td>Snoozes for 20.18 seconds every minute and enlarges fruits by 1.51x within a small range. It also helps Moon-type fruits (Moon Mango, Moon Blossom, Moonflower, etc.) stay on the plant after picking.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Panda</td><td>Jumps over and eats bamboo, increasing its selling value by 1.57x.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Polar Bear</td><td>May grant a Chilled or Frozen mutation to random fruits every 1.29 minutes, though the likelihood is just 10.14%.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Sea Otter</td><td>Acts like a living watering can. It sprays water on random plants every 15 seconds, helping their fruits grow faster.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Silver Monkey</td><td>Can return your fruits and veggies after selling them, but the probability is only 7.76%.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Turtle</td><td>Helps sprinklers (Basic, Advanced, Godly, Master, and Chocolate) last 20.47% longer.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Wasp</td><td>Turns a random fruit Pollinated every 29.46 minutes, then bites and raises an active pet's cooldown by almost a minute every 9.58 minutes.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Tarantula Hawk</td><td>Works like a Wasp, but it's quicker. This hawk can mutate a plant in 24.39 minutes and improves cooldown by 82.01 seconds.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Petal Bee</td><td>Not only does it make your flower plants not disappear after picking (1.13% chance), but it also gives a crop the Pollinated mutation after a round of 24.49 minutes.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Moth</td><td>Fills the Hunger Bar of an active pet completely every 12.55 minutes.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Brown Mouse</td><td>Allows players to jump higher and also gain 803.74 EXP every eight minutes, to age pretty fast.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Caterpillar</td><td>Leafy plants within its range produce fruits faster. Leafy plants are those with green leaves, such as Beanstalk, Grape, Eggplant, Pepper, etc.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Echo Frog</td><td>Nearly every 15 minutes, one of your crops will experience faster growth for an entire real-world day. The crop will keep giving fruits more rapidly than usual.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Giant Ant</td><td>When harvesting crops, there's a 10.38% possibility that they'll be cloned, giving you two fruits instead of one. Although rare plants are less likely to duplicate, candy fruits are more likely.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Grey Mouse</td><td>Gives the Mouse 521.75 EXP every 10 minutes and boosts players' jump height.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Owl</td><td>All walking critters in your garden gain 0.23 EXP every second. This is helpful in aging them and then selling them to unlock extra pet slots.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Praying Mantis</td><td>Prays for 10.30 seconds every 1.32 minutes, increasing your chance of finding a mutated fruit on its radar. You can get any normal mutation except event ones or those triggered by devs (i.e., Plasma and Dawnbound).</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Red Fox</td><td>Hops into your neighbor's garden every 8.57 minutes and tries to grab a seed from any of their non-event plants to bring you. Red Foxes have quite a low success rate if the garden has high-rarity seeds.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Red Giant Ant</td><td>With this animal, there's a 5.16% chance that picking normal fruits (especially berries) gives you an extra one in your inventory.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Snail</td><td>You might get a seed from the crop you just harvested (5.08% likelihood).</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Squirrel</td><td>When planting a seed, it might return to your inventory. This means it'll grow the crop for you, but you'll also get the seed back.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Chicken Zombie</td><td>You might get a Zombified fruit every 30 seconds (with only a 20.30% chance). Egg hatch speed also increases by 10.15%.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Firefly</td><td>Gives you a Shocked veggie or fruit every 1.32 minutes (3.07% success rate).</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Bear Bee</td><td>Grants a nearby fruit, the HoneyGlazed mutation, every 25 minutes.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Butterfly</td><td>Finds a plant with five or more mutations every 29.56 minutes and replaces all existing variants with the Rainbow mutation. She doesn't touch favorited plants.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Blood Owl</td><td>All pets roaming your farm earn an extra 0.53 EXP on top of what they get from being fed.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Dragonfly</td><td>Can turn a random fruit in your garden gold every 4.5 minutes.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Night Owl</td><td>Grants 0.23 EXP to all active critters.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Raccoon</td><td>Hangs out in your neighbor's garden every 15 minutes and duplicates a fruit they have for you (even event exclusives).</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Queen Bee</td><td>Completely refreshes an active pet's trait cooldown every 29.37 minutes and Pollinates one of your garden's plants about every 24.37 minutes.</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>Disco Bee</td><td>The first-ever pet that can give your plants the Disco mutation (only a 12.28% chance) every 19.49 minutes</td></tr>
